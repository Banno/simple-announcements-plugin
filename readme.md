# Simple Announcements Plugin
This example plugin is best used when following along with the [Build a Plugin with External API](https://jackhenry.dev/open-api-docs/plugins/tutorials/externalapiplugin/) tutorial.

See tutorial above for instructions on how to run.

## Notes
You will need to rename the `config-example.js` to just `config.js`.
